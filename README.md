This program calculates a user’s full holiday cost including the plane cost, hotel cost, and car rental cost.

● First, we get the following user inputs:

 a) city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (We can create some options for them. Remember: Each city will have different flight costs.)
 
 b) num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel
 
 c) rental_days: The number of days that they will be hiring a car for.

● Next, we create the following four functions:

a) hotel_cost: This function will take the num_nights as an argument, and return a total cost for the hotel stay (We can choose the price per night charged at the hotel).

b) plane_cost:This function will takethe city_flight as an argument and return a cost for the flight (We can choose the flight price)

c) car_rental:This function will take the rental_days as an argument and return the total cost of the car rental (we can choose the daily rental cost.)

d) holiday_cost: This function will take the three arguments hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. Using these three arguments, we return a total cost for the holiday.
